    <h3>Today Is Very Boring</h3>
      <p>
         Today is very boring,<br>
         it's a very boring day,<br>
         there is nothing much to look at,<br>
         there is nothing much to say,<br>
         there's a peacock on my snakers,<br>
         there's a penguin on my head,<br>
         there's a doormouse on my doorstep,<br>
         I am going back to bed.<br>
         <br>
         Today is very boring,<br>
         it is boring through and through,<br>
         there is absolutely nothing<br>
         that I think I want to do,<br>
         I see giants riding rhinos,<br>
         and an ogre with a sword,<br>
         there's a dragon blowing smoke rings,<br>
         I am positively bored.<br>
         <br>
         Today is very boring,<br>
         I can hardly help but yawn,<br>
         there's a flying saucer landing<br>
         in the middle of my lawn,<br>
         a volcano just erupted<br>
         less than half a mile away,<br>
         and I think I felt an earthquake,<br>
         it's a very boring day.<br>
