    <h1>Hello!</h1>
      <p>
            WESTMORELAND
            O that we now had here<br>
            But one ten thousand of those men in Englandâ€¨That do no work to-day!<br>
            
            KING HENRY V
            What's he that wishes so?<br>
            My cousin Westmoreland? No, my fair cousin:<br>
            If we are mark'd to die, we are enow<br>
            To do our country loss; and if to live,<br>
            The fewer men, the greater share of honour.<br>
            God's will! I pray thee, wish not one man more.<br>
